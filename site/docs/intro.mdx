  Support http-wizard on github ðŸ’ª
</div>

#### âœ¨ Http-wizard weaves TypeScript magic, offering a type-safe API client and ensuring a delightful end-to-end developer experience. âœ¨

It natively supports Fastify interface (literally made for it) and Zod or Typebox for validation

### What it can do:

- 100% type-safe api client with typescript magic (no code generation)
- Fastify first-class support
- React-query first-class support
- Zod and Typebox Type providers
- Delightful end-to-end developer experience (tRPC-like)
- Http standards / REST compatibility: you are owner of your routes
- Type inference utils

### Why not GraphQL or tRPC?

Both are excellent choices!

<b>Http-wizard</b> allows maintaining a standard HTTP API and to keep tools such
as Swagger, etc to document your API. For people who wants a tRPC-like DX but still
using fastify or Express with full control over route naming, http-wizard is made
for you! It combines the best of both worlds, ensuring a smooth, efficient, and
productive development process.

### How it works

Currently, http-wizard uses Zod or Typebox for validation, axios for data fetching.
Using Fastify for a new project is highly recommended for the best developer experience.

Here's how to integrate it into your project:
